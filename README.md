## ‚ößAbaout my career

### Why did I chose this career?
I chose Mechatronics engineering because I'm very curious about the mechanism behind the things we used everyday, and being able to program and assemble products on my own fascinates me a lot.
### What would be the first product I would create after finishing the University?
I would like to create a pain sensor to indicate the grade of sensitivity in people who suffer the same disease as me (Fibromyalgia and Juvenile degenerative Osteoarthritis). Also create some kind of mechatronic glove that helps with movement and can make daily tasks easier.
##Programmimg lenguages:
I'm not an expert, but I've learned some of Python last year.
